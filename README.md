This is a small project I created on writing Jest unit tests for pure Promise based functions in JavaScript.

## How To Run the Tests

### Online
- Head over to [![Repl.it](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repl.it-listProcess-lightgrey)](https://repl.it/@subz390/listProcess#README.md)
- Click the Run button, wait for 15-30 seconds for the slow public server to do its thing
- Or, manually run the scripts listed below.

### Locally
- Requirements: you'll need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed
- clone this repo to a folder on your local computer
- `git clone https://github.com/subz390/listProcess.git`
- install the dependencies, `npm install` `yarn install`
- and then you can run the scripts listed below


### Scripts
- `npm run test` in the bash console to run the test and view its results in the console.
- `npm run test:coverage` to run the test _and_ generate a coverage report.
- `npm run serve` to start serving the coverage report web pages.  `Ctrl+C` to stop the server.  Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
- `npm run test+serve` to do all the above.

For `yarn`, replace all the above `npm` with `yarn`.
